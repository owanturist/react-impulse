# @owanturist/signal

A lightweight, fine-grained reactive state management library for JavaScript and React applications.

## Why Signals?

Signals provide a simple yet powerful primitive for reactive state management:

- **Fine-grained reactivity** - Only components that depend on changed values re-render
- **Automatic dependency tracking** - No need to manually specify dependencies
- **Predictable updates** - Synchronous by default, with batching when needed
- **Lightweight** - Minimal API surface with no external dependencies
- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with excellent type inference

## Core Concepts

The library is built around a few key concepts:

### Signals

A **Signal** holds a reactive value that can be read and written. When the value changes, all dependent computations are automatically notified.

```ts
import { Signal } from "@owanturist/signal";

const count = Signal(0);

// Read the current value
console.log(count.get()); // 0

// Update the value
count.set(1);
console.log(count.get()); // 1
```

### Derived Signals

Create computed values that automatically update when their dependencies change:

```ts
const count = Signal(0);
const doubled = Signal.derive(() => count.get() * 2);

console.log(doubled.get()); // 0
count.set(5);
console.log(doubled.get()); // 10
```

### Effects

Run side effects when signal values change:

```ts
import { Signal, effect } from "@owanturist/signal";

const name = Signal("World");

effect(() => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name.get()}!`);
});
// Logs: "Hello, World!"

name.set("Signals");
// Logs: "Hello, Signals!"
```

## Packages

The library is split into focused packages:

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `@owanturist/signal` | Core signal primitives |
| `@owanturist/signal-react` | React hooks integration |
| `@owanturist/signal-form` | Type-safe form state management |

## Quick Example

Here's a complete example using signals with React:

```tsx
import { Signal, effect } from "@owanturist/signal";
import { useComputed } from "@owanturist/signal-react";

const count = Signal(0);

function Counter() {
  const value = useComputed(() => count.get());

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {value}</p>
      <button onClick={() => count.set(count.get() + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
