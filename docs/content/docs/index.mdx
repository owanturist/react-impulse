description: A lightweight, fine-grained reactive state management library for JavaScript and React
---

Signal is a reactive state management library built around a simple idea: **Signals** hold values, and **Monitors** track who is reading them. This two-part design enables automatic dependency tracking.

## The Problem

Modern UI frameworks need to know when to re-render. React solves this with explicit dependency arrays (`useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`), which are error-prone and tedious. Global state managers often trigger re-renders for any state change, requiring manual optimization.

Signal takes a different approach: dependencies are tracked automatically based on what your code actually reads. This eliminates the need to maintain dependency arrays or write selectors. Components subscribe to exactly what they use.

## How It Works

When you read a signal, you pass a Monitor. The signal records that this monitor cares about its value:

```ts
import { Signal, effect } from "@owanturist/signal"

const count = Signal(0)

effect((monitor) => {
  // The signal records: "this monitor watches me"
  console.log(count.read(monitor))
})
```

Later, when the signal's value changes, it notifies only the monitors that read it. Effects re-run. Derived values recompute. React components re-render. All automatically.

## The Packages

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `@owanturist/signal` | Core reactive primitives for any JavaScript environment |
| `@owanturist/signal-react` | React integration via `useComputed` and `useMonitor` hooks |
| `@owanturist/signal-form` | Type-safe form state management with validation |

## A Quick Example

Here's a React component using signals:

```tsx
import { Signal } from "@owanturist/signal"
import { useComputed } from "@owanturist/signal-react"

const count = Signal(0)

function Counter() {
  const value = useComputed((monitor) => count.read(monitor))

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {value}</p>
      <button onClick={() => count.write((c) => c + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The component automatically re-renders when `count` changes.
