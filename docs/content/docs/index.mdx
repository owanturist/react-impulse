# @owanturist/signal

A lightweight, fine-grained reactive state management library for JavaScript and React applications.

## Why Signals?

Signals provide a simple yet powerful primitive for reactive state management:

- **Fine-grained reactivity** - Only components that depend on changed values re-render
- **Automatic dependency tracking** - No need to manually specify dependencies
- **Predictable updates** - Synchronous by default, with batching when needed
- **Lightweight** - Minimal API surface with no external dependencies
- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with excellent type inference

## Core Concepts

The library is built around two key concepts that work together: **Signals** hold values, and **Monitors** track who is reading them.

### Signals

A **Signal** holds a reactive value that can be read and written. When the value changes, all dependent computations are automatically notified through the Monitor system.

```ts
import { Signal, effect } from "@owanturist/signal"

const count = Signal(0)

// Read the value inside an effect (which provides a monitor)
effect((monitor) => {
  console.log(count.read(monitor)) // 0
})

// Update the value
count.write(1) // Effect re-runs, logs: 1
```

### Derived Signals

Create computed values that automatically update when their dependencies change:

```ts
const count = Signal(0)
const doubled = Signal((monitor) => count.read(monitor) * 2)

effect((monitor) => {
  console.log(doubled.read(monitor)) // 0
})

count.write(5) // Effect logs: 10
```

### Effects

Run side effects when signal values change:

```ts
import { Signal, effect } from "@owanturist/signal"

const name = Signal("World")

effect((monitor) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name.read(monitor)}!`)
})
// Logs: "Hello, World!"

name.write("Signals")
// Logs: "Hello, Signals!"
```

## Packages

The library is split into focused packages:

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `@owanturist/signal` | Core signal primitives |
| `@owanturist/signal-react` | React hooks integration |
| `@owanturist/signal-form` | Type-safe form state management |

## Quick Example

Here's a complete example using signals with React:

```tsx
import { Signal } from "@owanturist/signal"
import { useComputed } from "@owanturist/signal-react"

const count = Signal(0)

function Counter() {
  const value = useComputed((monitor) => count.read(monitor))

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {value}</p>
      <button onClick={() => count.write((c) => c + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
