description: API reference for the useMonitor hook
---

The `useMonitor` hook provides direct access to a Monitor instance for advanced signal reading scenarios.

## `useMonitor(){:dart}` [#use-monitor]

```ts
function useMonitor(): Monitor
```

Returns a Monitor instance that can be used to read signals. The component subscribes to all signals read through this monitor.

<section className="typedef">

- `@returns Monitor{:dart}` A Monitor instance for reading signals. The monitor is stable across renders.

</section>

```tsx tab="Example"
import { Signal, type Monitor } from "@owanturist/signal"
import { useMonitor } from "@owanturist/signal-react"

const count = Signal(0)

function Counter() {
  const monitor = useMonitor()
  const value = count.read(monitor)

  return <div>Count: {value}</div>
}
```

## Monitor Interface

```ts
interface Monitor {
  // Opaque type used internally by signals
}
```

The `Monitor` type is intentionally opaque. You pass it to `signal.read(monitor){:ts}` to track dependencies. The monitor handles subscription management internally.

## When to Use

<Callout type="warn">
  Most applications should use `useComputed` instead of `useMonitor`. Only use `useMonitor` when you need direct monitor access for advanced patterns.
</Callout>

Use `useMonitor` when:

- Building custom hooks that need low-level monitor access
- Integrating with third-party libraries that expect a monitor
- Implementing patterns not covered by `useComputed`

## Building Custom Hooks

Use `useMonitor` as a building block for custom signal-reading hooks:

```tsx
import { Signal, type Monitor } from "@owanturist/signal"
import { useMonitor } from "@owanturist/signal-react"

const count = Signal(0)

function useSignalValue<T>(read: (monitor: Monitor) => T): T {
  const monitor = useMonitor()
  return read(monitor)
}

function Counter() {
  const value = useSignalValue((monitor) => count.read(monitor))

  return <div>Count: {value}</div>
}
```

## Comparison with useComputed

| Feature | `useMonitor` | `useComputed` |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Returns | `Monitor` | Computed value |
| Memoization | None | Optional via dependencies |
| Custom equality | None | Supported via options |
| Use case | Advanced patterns | Most applications |

```tsx tab="useMonitor"
import { Signal } from "@owanturist/signal"
import { useMonitor } from "@owanturist/signal-react"

const count = Signal(0)

function Counter() {
  const monitor = useMonitor()
  const value = count.read(monitor)

  return <div>{value}</div>
}
```

```tsx tab="useComputed (preferred)"
import { Signal } from "@owanturist/signal"
import { useComputed } from "@owanturist/signal-react"

const count = Signal(0)

function Counter() {
  const value = useComputed(count)

  return <div>{value}</div>
}
```
