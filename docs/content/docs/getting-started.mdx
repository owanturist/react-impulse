# Getting Started

Learn how to install and start using `@owanturist/signal` in your project.

## Installation

Install the core package using your preferred package manager:

```bash tab="npm"
npm install @owanturist/signal
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm add @owanturist/signal
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn add @owanturist/signal
```

For React applications, also install the React integration:

```bash tab="npm"
npm install @owanturist/signal-react
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm add @owanturist/signal-react
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn add @owanturist/signal-react
```

## Basic Usage

### Creating a Signal

Use the `Signal` function to create a reactive value:

```ts
import { Signal, effect } from "@owanturist/signal"

// Create a signal with an initial value
const count = Signal(0)

// Read and react to changes using an effect
effect((monitor) => {
  console.log(count.read(monitor)) // 0
})

// Write a new value
count.write(1) // Effect logs: 1

// Update based on previous value
count.write((current) => current + 1) // Effect logs: 2
```

### Creating Derived Signals

Derived signals automatically compute their value based on other signals:

```ts
const firstName = Signal("John")
const lastName = Signal("Doe")

// This signal automatically updates when firstName or lastName changes
const fullName = Signal((monitor) => {
  return `${firstName.read(monitor)} ${lastName.read(monitor)}`
})

effect((monitor) => {
  console.log(fullName.read(monitor)) // "John Doe"
})

firstName.write("Jane") // Effect logs: "Jane Doe"
```

### Using Effects

Effects run side effects when their dependencies change:

```ts
import { Signal, effect } from "@owanturist/signal"

const temperature = Signal(20)

// This effect runs immediately and whenever temperature changes
const stop = effect((monitor) => {
  console.log(`Current temperature: ${temperature.read(monitor)}°C`)
})

temperature.write(25) // Logs: "Current temperature: 25°C"
temperature.write(30) // Logs: "Current temperature: 30°C"

// Stop the effect when no longer needed
stop()
temperature.write(35) // No log - effect has been stopped
```

## React Integration

### Using Signals in Components

Use the `useComputed` hook to read signal values in React components:

```tsx
import { Signal } from "@owanturist/signal"
import { useComputed } from "@owanturist/signal-react"

// Create signals outside of components
const count = Signal(0)

function Counter() {
  // useComputed subscribes to signals and triggers re-renders
  const value = useComputed((monitor) => count.read(monitor))

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {value}</p>
      <button onClick={() => count.write((c) => c + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => count.write((c) => c - 1)}>
        Decrement
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Batching Updates

When updating multiple signals, use `batch` to avoid unnecessary re-renders:

```tsx
import { Signal, batch } from "@owanturist/signal"

const firstName = Signal("John")
const lastName = Signal("Doe")
const age = Signal(30)

function updateUser(first: string, last: string, newAge: number) {
  // Without batch: 3 separate updates, 3 re-renders
  // With batch: 1 combined update, 1 re-render
  batch(() => {
    firstName.write(first)
    lastName.write(last)
    age.write(newAge)
  })
}
```

## TypeScript Support

The library provides full TypeScript support with excellent type inference:

```ts
import { Signal, type ReadonlySignal } from "@owanturist/signal"

// Type is inferred as Signal<number>
const count = Signal(0)

// Explicit typing for function parameters
function double(signal: ReadonlySignal<number>): ReadonlySignal<number> {
  return Signal((monitor) => signal.read(monitor) * 2)
}

const doubled = double(count)
```
