title: Reading and Writing Signals
description: Patterns for reading signal values with and without tracking, writing updates, and batching changes
---

This guide covers the essential patterns for interacting with signal values: reading with dependency tracking, writing updates, selectively opting out of tracking, and grouping multiple writes into a single notification.

## Reading Signal Values [#reading]

To read a signal's current value and subscribe to future changes, pass a Monitor to `.read(){:ts}`. The monitor records the dependency so that your effect or derived signal re-runs when the value changes.

```ts
import { Signal, effect } from "@owanturist/signal"

const count = Signal(0)

effect((monitor) => {
  // count is now tracked by this effect's monitor
  console.log(count.read(monitor))
})

count.write(1) // Effect re-runs, logs: 1
```

Each monitor tracks its own set of dependencies independently. Changing a signal only notifies monitors that actually read it.

## Writing Signal Values [#writing]

To update a writable signal, call `.write(){:ts}` with either a replacement value or a transform function:

```ts
import { Signal } from "@owanturist/signal"

const count = Signal(0)

// Replace with a specific value
count.write(42)

// Transform the current value
count.write((current) => current + 1)
```

Use the transform function form when the new value depends on the current one. This avoids stale-value bugs when multiple writes happen in sequence.

## Reading Without Tracking [#untracked]

Use `untracked(){:ts}` to read a signal's current value without establishing a dependency. The effect or derived signal will not re-run when the untracked signal changes.

```ts
import { Signal, effect, untracked } from "@owanturist/signal"

const count = Signal(0)
const multiplier = Signal(2)

effect((monitor) => {
  // count is tracked, multiplier is NOT
  const result = count.read(monitor) * untracked(multiplier)
  console.log(result)
})

count.write(5)       // Effect runs
multiplier.write(3)  // Effect does NOT run
```

Common scenarios for `untracked(){:ts}`:

- **Event handlers** that only need the value at the moment of the event
- **Async operations** where future changes are irrelevant to the already-started operation
- **Initialization** that extracts a value once without ongoing reactivity

See the [untracked API reference](/docs/api/untracked) for the full API surface including the factory overload and nested usage.

## Batching Updates [#batching]

Use `batch(){:ts}` to group multiple signal writes into a single notification. Without batching, each `.write(){:ts}` call immediately notifies all dependent monitors. With `batch(){:ts}`, notifications are deferred until the function completes.

```ts
import { Signal, effect, batch } from "@owanturist/signal"

const firstName = Signal("John")
const lastName = Signal("Doe")

effect((monitor) => {
  console.log(`${firstName.read(monitor)} ${lastName.read(monitor)}`)
})

batch(() => {
  firstName.write("Jane")
  lastName.write("Smith")
})
// Logs once: "Jane Smith"
```

Use `batch(){:ts}` when updating multiple related signals together to avoid intermediate states and redundant effect executions. Batches can also be nested — the outermost batch controls when notifications fire.

See the [batch API reference](/docs/api/batch) for advanced patterns including reading values inside a batch and nested batching.

## Choosing Between Effects and Derived Signals [#effects-vs-derived]

| Use Case | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Computing a value from other signals | Derived signal |
| Transforming or filtering data | Derived signal |
| Side effects (DOM, network, logging) | `effect{:dart}` |
| Syncing with external systems | `effect{:dart}` |

Effects are for **actions**. Derived signals are for **values**.
