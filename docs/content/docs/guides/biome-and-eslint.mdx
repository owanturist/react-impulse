description: How to configure Biome and ESLint to enforce exhaustive dependency arrays for useComputed
---

The `useComputed` hook accepts an optional dependency array, similar to React's built-in hooks like `useMemo{:ts}` and `useEffect{:ts}`. Linters can catch missing dependencies automatically when configured to recognize `useComputed`.

## Biome

Add `useComputed` to Biome's `useExhaustiveDependencies` rule in your `biome.jsonc` (or `biome.json`):

```jsonc title="biome.jsonc"
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "correctness": {
        "useExhaustiveDependencies": {
          "level": "error",
          "options": {
            "hooks": [
              { "name": "useComputed", "closureIndex": 0, "dependenciesIndex": 1 }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `closureIndex: 0` tells Biome that the first argument is the closure whose dependencies should be tracked.
- `dependenciesIndex: 1` tells Biome that the second argument is the dependency array.

See the [Biome `useExhaustiveDependencies` documentation](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-exhaustive-dependencies/) for the full list of options.

## ESLint

Add `useComputed` to the `additionalHooks` option of the `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule in your ESLint config:

```json title=".eslintrc.json"
{
  "rules": {
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": ["warn", {
      "additionalHooks": "(useComputed)"
    }]
  }
}
```

The `additionalHooks` option accepts a regex pattern, so you can combine multiple hooks in a single expression:

```json
"additionalHooks": "(useComputed|useCustomHook)"
```

See the [ESLint `exhaustive-deps` documentation](https://react.dev/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/exhaustive-deps) for more details.
