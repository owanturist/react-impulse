title: Signals, Monitors, and Reactivity
description: Understanding the core reactive primitives and how they work together
---

At the heart of this library are three concepts that work together: **Signals** hold values, **Monitors** track who is reading them, and **Effects** run code when values change.

## The Core Idea

A Signal is a container for a value that can change over time. The **Monitor** makes it reactive by tracking who is reading the signal.

```ts
import { Signal, effect } from "@owanturist/signal"

const count = Signal(0)

effect((monitor) => {
  console.log(count.read(monitor)) // 0
})

count.write(1) // Effect re-runs, logs: 1
```

When you call `count.read(monitor)`, two things happen:
1. The signal returns its current value
2. The signal records that this monitor is interested in its value

Later, when `count.write(1)` changes the value, the signal notifies all monitors that previously read it. Those monitors then trigger their associated code to re-run.

## Why Monitors Exist

The Monitor solves dependency tracking by making it **explicit** and **scoped**:

```ts
const theme = Signal("light")
const fontSize = Signal(14)

effect((monitor) => {
  // This monitor now "watches" theme
  document.body.className = theme.read(monitor)
})

effect((monitor) => {
  // This monitor now "watches" fontSize
  document.body.style.fontSize = `${fontSize.read(monitor)}px`
})

theme.write("dark")    // Only the first effect re-runs
fontSize.write(16)     // Only the second effect re-runs
```

Each effect gets its own monitor. When `theme` changes, it only notifies the monitors that actually read it.

## The Read-Write Cycle

Signals have two fundamental operations:

```ts
const name = Signal("Alice")

effect((monitor) => {
  // Reading: requires a monitor
  const value = name.read(monitor)
  console.log(`Hello, ${value}`)
})

// Writing: doesn't need a monitor
name.write("Bob")

// Writing with a transform function
const count = Signal(0)
count.write((current) => current + 1)
```

## Dynamic Dependency Tracking

Dependencies are tracked **dynamically** based on what actually gets read:

```ts
const showDetails = Signal(false)
const summary = Signal("Brief info")
const details = Signal("Full details here...")

effect((monitor) => {
  if (showDetails.read(monitor)) {
    console.log(details.read(monitor))
  } else {
    console.log(summary.read(monitor))
  }
})
```

When `showDetails` is `false`, changing `details` does nothing - the effect didn't read it on the last run.

## Derived Signals

Signals can compute their value from other signals:

```ts
const price = Signal(100)
const quantity = Signal(2)

// Derived signal - computes its value from others
const total = Signal((monitor) => price.read(monitor) * quantity.read(monitor))

effect((monitor) => {
  console.log(`Total: $${total.read(monitor)}`) // Total: $200
})

price.write(150) // Effect logs: Total: $300
```

### Chaining Derived Signals

Derived signals can depend on other derived signals:

```ts
const price = Signal(100)
const quantity = Signal(2)
const taxRate = Signal(0.1)

const subtotal = Signal((monitor) => price.read(monitor) * quantity.read(monitor))
const tax = Signal((monitor) => subtotal.read(monitor) * taxRate.read(monitor))
const total = Signal((monitor) => subtotal.read(monitor) + tax.read(monitor))

effect((monitor) => {
  console.log(`Total: $${total.read(monitor)}`) // Total: $220
})
```

### Lazy Evaluation and Memoization

Derived signals only compute when read, and values are cached:

```ts
const count = Signal(0)

const expensive = Signal((monitor) => {
  console.log("Computing...")
  return count.read(monitor) * 2
})

count.write(1)
count.write(2)
count.write(3)
// No "Computing..." logged yet

effect((monitor) => {
  console.log(expensive.read(monitor)) // Now: "Computing..." then "6"
  console.log(expensive.read(monitor)) // Just "6" (cached)
})
```

### Bidirectional Derived Signals

Create derived signals that can be written to:

```ts
const celsius = Signal(0)

const fahrenheit = Signal(
  (monitor) => celsius.read(monitor) * 9/5 + 32,
  (value) => celsius.write((value - 32) * 5/9)
)

fahrenheit.write(212) // celsius becomes 100
```

## Effects

Effects run side effects in response to signal changes:

```ts
const userId = Signal("user-1")

const stop = effect((monitor) => {
  const id = userId.read(monitor)
  const subscription = subscribeToUser(id)

  // Cleanup runs before re-execution and when stopped
  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe()
  }
})

stop() // Disconnect the effect
```

### Effects vs Derived Signals

| Use Case | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Computing a value from other signals | Derived signal |
| Transforming or filtering data | Derived signal |
| Side effects (DOM, network, logging) | Effect |
| Syncing with external systems | Effect |

Effects are for **actions**. Derived signals are for **values**.

## Reading Without Tracking

Use `untracked` to read a signal without establishing a dependency:

```ts
import { Signal, effect, untracked } from "@owanturist/signal"

const count = Signal(0)
const multiplier = Signal(2)

effect((monitor) => {
  // count is tracked, multiplier is NOT
  const result = count.read(monitor) * untracked(multiplier)
  console.log(result)
})

count.write(5)       // Effect runs
multiplier.write(3)  // Effect does NOT run
```

## Batching Updates

Group multiple updates to prevent intermediate effect runs:

```ts
import { Signal, effect, batch } from "@owanturist/signal"

const firstName = Signal("John")
const lastName = Signal("Doe")

effect((monitor) => {
  console.log(`${firstName.read(monitor)} ${lastName.read(monitor)}`)
})

batch(() => {
  firstName.write("Jane")
  lastName.write("Smith")
})
// Logs once: "Jane Smith"
```

## Summary

| Concept | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Signal | Holds a value that can change |
| Monitor | Tracks which signals have been read |
| Derived Signal | Computes a value from other signals |
| Effect | Runs side effects when signals change |
| `batch()` | Groups updates to prevent intermediate runs |
| `untracked()` | Reads without creating dependencies |
