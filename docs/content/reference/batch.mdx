## Overview

The `batch` function optimizes multiple Impulse updates by coalescing them into a single notification cycle.

## Function Signature

```typescript
function batch(execute: (scope: Scope) => void): void
```

## Parameters

- `execute`: A function that performs multiple `Impulse#setValue` calls. It receives a non-tracking `Scope` for synchronous reads.

## Description

Batching improves performance by preventing intermediate re-renders or notifications when multiple impulses are updated in sequence. All updates within the `execute` function are collected and notified as a single batch.

## Examples

```typescript
const counter1 = Impulse(0)
const counter2 = Impulse(0)

batch((scope) => {
  counter1.setValue(1)
  counter2.setValue(2)
  // Only one notification cycle occurs here
})
```
