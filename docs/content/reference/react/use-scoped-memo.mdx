description: API documentation for the useScopedMemo React hook
---

## Overview

The `useScopedMemo` hook memoizes computations that depend on impulses, similar to `React.useMemo` but with reactive scope support.

## Function Signature

```typescript
function useScopedMemo<T>(
  factory: (scope: Scope) => T,
  dependencies: DependencyList,
): T
```

## Parameters

- `factory`: A function that receives a `Scope` and computes the memoized value
- `dependencies`: An array of dependencies that control when the memoization is invalidated

## Returns

The memoized value of type `T`.

## Description

`useScopedMemo` combines impulse reactivity with React's memoization. The factory function is re-executed when either the dependencies change or when any impulses read within the scope change.

## Examples

```typescript
const memoizedValue = useScopedMemo(
  (scope) => expensiveComputation(impulse.getValue(scope)),
  [someDependency],
)
```
