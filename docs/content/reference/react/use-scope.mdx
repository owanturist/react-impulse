description: API documentation for the useScope React hook

## Overview

The `useScope` hook returns a reactive scope tied to the component lifecycle.

## Function Signature

```typescript
function useScope(): Scope
```

## Returns

A `Scope` instance that triggers component re-renders when read impulses change.

## Description

`useScope` provides a scope that enables reactive impulse reads within React components. When impulses are read within this scope, the component automatically re-renders when those impulses change.

## Examples

```typescript
function Counter() {
  const scope = useScope()
  const impulse = Impulse(0)

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {impulse.getValue(scope)}
    </div>
  )
}
```
