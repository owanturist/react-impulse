## Overview [toc] [#overview]

<p id="overview" className="-mb-5 scroll-mt-100" />

`Scope` is an opaque object that manages dependency tracking and lifecycle for reactive computations in react-impulse. It enables automatic tracking of impulse reads, deterministic scheduling of updates, and memory-safe cleanup.

Scopes are created using factory functions and hooks, never directly by consumers. They come in two types:

- **Tracking scopes**: Automatically track impulse reads and trigger reactions when dependencies change.
- **Non-tracking scopes**: Allow reading impulse values without establishing dependencies.

```ts
import { useScope, untrack } from "react-impulse"

// Tracking scope in React
const scope = useScope()

// Non-tracking scope
untrack((scope) => {
  const value = impulse.getValue(scope)
  // No dependency tracking here
})
```

## `interface Scope{:ts}` [#scope-interface]

```ts
interface Scope {
  readonly version?: number
}
```

An opaque object representing a reactive scope. The `version` property is for debugging and diagnostics only and should not be relied upon in application code.

Scopes are always obtained through factory functions or hooks, never constructed directly.

### Obtaining Scopes [#obtaining-scopes]

Scopes are created through various factory functions and React hooks:

**Framework-agnostic factories:**

- [`batch`](/docs/reference/batch) - Batches updates with a non-tracking scope
- [`untrack`](/docs/reference/untrack) - Runs code with a non-tracking scope
- [`subscribe`](/docs/reference/subscribe) - Creates a reactive subscription

**React hooks:**

- [`useScope`](/docs/reference/react/use-scope) - Creates a component-level tracking scope
- [`useScoped`](/docs/reference/react/use-scoped) - Reads impulses reactively in components
- [`useScopedMemo`](/docs/reference/react/use-scoped-memo) - Memoizes reactive computations
- [`useScopedCallback`](/docs/reference/react/use-scoped-callback) - Memoizes reactive callbacks
- [`useScopedEffect`](/docs/reference/react/use-scoped-effect) - Runs reactive effects
- [`useScopedLayoutEffect`](/docs/reference/react/use-scoped-layout-effect) - Runs reactive layout effects
