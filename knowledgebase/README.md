# Knowledgebase

Purpose: a single source of truth that powers AI-assisted development, autogenerated documentation (Diátaxis), and an MCP server users can connect to.

## How to use

- Add or update entries under `knowledgebase/entries/**` using the templates in `knowledgebase/templates/`.
- Entry types: `feature`, `bugfix`, `concept`, `decision`, `test-spec`, `doc-snippet`.
- Each change to code must start with a KB entry (feature/bugfix/decision). Write acceptance-criteria and a test-plan.
- Ask your AI agent to implement the change based on the KB, then review and refine the KB if needed.
- Generate docs from the KB; don’t hand-edit generated docs.

Conventions

- Frontmatter keys use kebab-case (e.g., `last-reviewed`, `acceptance-criteria`, `api-changes`, `test-plan`).
- `diataxis` is explicit in frontmatter for landing doc intent.
- For `type: test-spec`, `relates-to` must include at least one existing entry id.

## Status

- See `knowledgebase/PLAN.md` for the end-to-end plan, schema details, and phased deliverables.

## Why this structure

- Clean separation of curated knowledge (KB) and generated artifacts (docs site).
- Repeatable and reviewable: schema-validated frontmatter and enforceable conventions.
- Scales to MCP so others can plug this knowledge into their AI tools.
