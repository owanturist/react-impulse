# Knowledgebase

Purpose: a single source of truth that powers AI-assisted development and autogenerated documentation (Di√°taxis).

## How to use

- Add or update concept entries under `knowledgebase/entries/` using the template in `knowledgebase/templates/concept.md`.
- Each concept documents architectural decisions, design patterns, and key mental models.
- **Entry identification**: KB entries are referenced by their filename (without `.md` extension). For example, `signal-concept.md` is referenced as `signal-concept`.
- Ask your AI agent to implement changes based on KB concepts, then review and refine the KB if needed.
- Generate docs from the KB using AI synthesis; generated docs can be manually refined for better examples and prose, but use the validation checklist (see AI-SYNTHESIS-GUIDE.md) to determine if the KB should be updated first.

## Creating a New Concept Entry

1. Copy the template: `cp templates/concept.md entries/your-concept-name.md`
2. Fill in the frontmatter fields:
   - `title`: Human-readable name
   - `type`: Always "concept"
   - `packages`: List of affected packages (use YAML list syntax with `-`)
   - `relates-to`: Filenames of related entries without `.md` (use YAML list syntax with `-`)
3. Write the concept documentation below the frontmatter

## Conventions

- Frontmatter keys use kebab-case (e.g., `relates-to`).

## Status

- See `knowledgebase/PLAN.md` for the end-to-end plan, schema details, and phased deliverables.

## Why this structure

- Clean separation of curated knowledge (KB) and generated artifacts (docs site).
- Repeatable and reviewable: schema-validated frontmatter and enforceable conventions.
