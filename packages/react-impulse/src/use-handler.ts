   * Despise React official documentation pointing out:
   *
   * > Do not write or read ref.current during rendering, except for initialization.
   * > This makes your componentâ€™s behavior unpredictable.
   *
   * While technically useLatest does write to ref.current during rendering (after the initial one), it's a widely accepted pattern because:
   * - It doesn't trigger re-renders.
   * - The side effect is predictable and serves a specific purpose (always having the latest value).
   * - It helps solve the common "stale closure" problem.
   * This pattern is recommended and used in many React resources despite the general warning in the useRef documentation.
   * The key is that the update to the ref doesn't directly influence the rendering output of the component in the same render cycle.
